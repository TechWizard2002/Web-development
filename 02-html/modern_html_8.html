            <h2>What is HTML </h2>
            <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a markup language that is used to create web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page by using tags. Tags are instructions that tell the web browser how to display the content of a web page.

            <h2>What is semantic HTML</h2>
            <p>Semantic HTML refers to the practice of using HTML elements in a way that conveys the meaning and structure of the content, rather than merely defining its presentation or appearance. In other words, semantic HTML aims to make the markup more descriptive and meaningful, allowing both humans and machines (like search engines and assistive technologies) to better understand the purpose and relationships of different elements on a webpage.

                The term "semantic" comes from the word "semantics," which refers to the study of meaning in language. In the context of HTML, semantic elements are those that have a clear and specific meaning, indicating what type of content they contain and how that content relates to other parts of the page.</p>
