        <p  id="green"> Physics Wallah (PW), India’s leading ed-tech platform, is proud to announce a significant milestone for its skilling vertical, PW Skills. It has now emerged as the largest online platform for teaching tech skills to an impressive 1.5 lakh learners, offering courses in Hindi, English, and Hinglish. Among these learners, 50,000 are enrolled in paid batches, while the remaining have benefited from the free courses. Notably, 30,000 learners hail from the Hindi heartland, encompassing regions such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and other states. Achieving this milestone within a mere five-month span is a testament to the power of PW’s existing community and digital distribution, which have been instrumental in driving this growth.

            With a mission to bridge the gap between the demand and supply of professionals with new-age relevant tech skills, PW Skills already offers hybrid courses in data science, Java, C++, full-stack web development, and other tech courses at disruptive pricing for INR 3,500 onwards. Going forward, PW Skills plans to expand into joint certification courses with top colleges, diploma courses, and technology courses in vernacular languages. The training programs cater to learners of all levels, from fundamentals to advanced, ensuring accessibility and ease of understanding. PW Skills recently partnered with NSDC to make skilling, reskilling and upskilling affordable for learners.</p>
