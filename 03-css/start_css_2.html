    <h1>CASCADING STYLE SHEET- CSS</h1>
    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a rule-based language that describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts12. It saves a lot of work as it can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once1. External stylesheets are stored in CSS files1 </p>
