------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tags
----
Tags are used to identify HTML elements. They are always enclosed in angle brackets (< and >).
Tags can be either opening tags or closing tags. 
Opening tags indicate the beginning of an element, while closing tags indicate the end of an element.
example:
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <h1> ->opening tag of heading element.
    </h1> ->closing tag of heading element.
self closing tags: there is only opening tag. example: <br /> or <br> , <img> ,<hr>


elements
---------

Elements are the basic building blocks of HTML pages. They are made up of tags and content. The content of an element can be text, images, other elements, or a combination of these.
(elemetnt = <tag> content </tag>)
example: <h1>This is a heading </h1> -> element
          h1 -> is tag
          This is a heading -> is content

attributes
----------
Attributes are used to provide additional information about elements. They are always specified in the opening tag of an element. Attributes are made up of a name and a value. The name is a unique identifier for the attribute, while the value is the data that is associated with the attribute
example: <h1 title="This is the title of the heading">This is a heading</h1>
        title ->is attribute
        This is the title of the heading -> is value

        <section id="welcome-section"> </section>
        id -> is attribute
        welcome-section -> is value
